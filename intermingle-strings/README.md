Write a function to intermingle two strings, alternating characters between strings
and returning a new string.

If the strings are of unequal length all remaining characters should be added to
the end of the string.

examples:

intermingle('hello', 'world') should return 'hweolrllod'
intermingle('abc', 'defgh') should return 'adbecfgh'
